# Reading Tracker README
## What is Reading Tracker?
Reading tracker is an python program you can run in any python IDE. It keeps track of what you read. When it is run, it asks to enter a new book name. If you want to enter a new book, it will save it to a new line in the file. It will save to a file named reader.txt that is in the folder Reading-Tracker. You can then go into that file (reader.txt) and view all of the books you have read so far!
